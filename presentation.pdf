Udapeople CI/CD Proposal

What is DevOps?

DevOps is a mindset and a culure adopated in a company to help automate tasks that are normally manual and error prone.

What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for continous integration and continous deployment.These two processes makes up continous delivery.
CI/CD essentially seeks automate the build,test and analyze (CI) and the deployment stage (CD) in a way such that 
a pipeline is created from the developers code straight to production.No longer do teams have to manually install
and configure CI/CD servers to perform these tasks instead there are various CI/CD DevOps teams can use to 
quickly create pipelines to deployement.The tools chosen would depend on the needs of the company.There are many benefits these
tools provide.However, I must say the advantages out weigh the disadvantages.Lets take a closer look at some benefits this could
give our team here at Udapeople.

1. Deploy to Production Without Manual Checks
   This means less time for applications to get to the market and reach it's consumers. 
   Customers are happier, referrals increase, and revenue is boosted.
   
2. Detect Security Vulnerabilities
   Prevents embarrassing or costly security holes. This avoids costs associated with data breaches
  (exposed PII or PHI) and decreased revenue from loss of business reputation and client trust.

The points outlined above among others all seek to increase revenue,avoid unneccessary avoids, protect revenue or reduce costs.The evidence
is clear that Udapeople would be doing a great diservice to itself if this mindset and tools are not integrated into how we approach
automation.Not everything can be automated but it is best practice to automate as much as possible.
